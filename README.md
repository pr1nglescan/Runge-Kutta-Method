# Runge-Kutta-Method
Coding project for my Physics 2601: Classical and Quantum Waves course. Usually, we model 
the motion of a pendulum using the small angle approximation, but this doesn't always work
when there's a large amplitude. Using the Runge Kutta method, we can model a pendulum's 
motion computationally and output a table of its displacement over time.

To learn more about the method, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods
